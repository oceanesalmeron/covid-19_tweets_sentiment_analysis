# Covid-19 tweets sentiment analysis
*By Oc√©ane Salmeron (ING5, BDA 2)*

**Project**

Sentiment analysis is a field of NLP (Natural language processing) used to determine and explore feelings and emotions about a subject.

In this project I analyzed tweets related to covid-19 focussing on polarity (positive, neutral, negative). The goal is to perform text classification.

**Data**

Data used if from a kaggle dataset ([access here](https://www.kaggle.com/datatattle/covid-19-nlp-text-classification)). The tweets have been pulled from Twitter and manual tagging has been done then. The names and usernames have been given codes to avoid any privacy concerns.
